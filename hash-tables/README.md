# Hash Tables Sprint Challenge

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through some algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the `.c` skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with `make tests`.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (ideally using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the `hashtable.h` header file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

By solving the problems in this Sprint Challenge, you can earn a total of 19 points, with an additional 4 available by completing the Computation Stretch challenge. Each problem's point value is scaled according to approximately how much time and effort it should take, so plan your time out accordingly.

Theory of Computation - 9 pts
State Machine - 5 pts
Boolean 1 - 1 pt
Boolean 2 - 1 pt
Boolean 3 - 2 pt
Hash Tables - 10 pts
ex1 - 5 pts
ex2 - 5 pts
Computation Stretch - 4 pts
Truth Table - 1 pt
Sum - 1 pt
Carry - 2 pts
Stretch points will only be counted if all other problems have been completed.
